# MackCoin Cryptocurrency 

## Overview
Mackcoin is a simple cryptocurrency writtin in Python 3. At the moment the blockchain runs on a single machine and does not yet support peer-to-peer communications (note: this single-node blockchain has reduced security when compared to a decentralized, distributed blockchain). The client runs through a command line interface for easy operation.
